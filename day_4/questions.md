## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method is kind of like a formula that you can use to organize bits of information and call upon insert into your code whenever you need.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello()
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone("Sam")
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
None at the moment. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the final bonus question section of ex21.
